# Credit Default Risk with Home Credit dataset 

Machine learning model to predict if an applicant will be able to repay the loan. The Home credit dataset on kaggle is used in the project. 

As the dataset is large and there are a lot of features I used xgboost classifier to determine feature importance you can use any other technique if you want and feel free to play with various parameters and test new things. If you want to talk about this project, get in touch with me through mail and we can discuss how we can improve the project.
